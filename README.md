# 🌍 Address-Service

### Global Address & Geo Intelligence Microservice

Part of the **Omnixys Ecosystem**

---

## 📖 Overview

**Address** is a globally scalable, high-performance Address & Geo-Data Microservice designed for enterprise systems such as FinTech, Identity, Event Management, KYC, and Compliance platforms.

It provides a normalized, geo-spatially optimized data model for worldwide location data and acts as the single source of truth for all geo-related information inside the Omnixys ecosystem.

> Address is not just an address CRUD service —
> it is a structured global geo intelligence layer.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Address solves common architectural problems:

- ❌ Duplicate country/state logic in multiple services
- ❌ Inconsistent address formatting
- ❌ Missing geo coordinates
- ❌ Poor performance on spatial queries
- ❌ Weak data integrity across regions

Address provides:

- ✅ Normalized global address hierarchy
- ✅ ISO-compliant country metadata
- ✅ Geo-spatial queries via PostGIS
- ✅ Strong relational integrity
- ✅ Optimized search (trigram + GIST)
- ✅ External data seeding

## 🌍 Domain Model

### Hierarchical Structure

```
Continent
  └── Subregion
        └── Country
              └── State
                    └── City
                          └── PostalCode
                                └── Street
                                      └── HouseNumber
```

## 🧱 Core Entities

### Continent

- id
- name
- code

### Subregion

- name
- continent_id (FK)

### Country

- id
- name
- iso2
- iso3
- numericCode
- population
- areaSqKm

## 🗺 Geo-Spatial Capabilities

Address uses **PostGIS** for spatial queries.

Example use cases:

- Radius search around coordinates
- Nearest city lookup
- Geofencing
- Distance calculation
- Proximity-based suggestions

### Example Spatial Column

```sql
location GEOGRAPHY(Point, 4326)
```

### Index Strategy

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_street_location
ON address.street USING GIST (location);

CREATE INDEX idx_street_name_trgm
ON address.street USING GIN (name gin_trgm_ops);
```

---

## 🚀 Seeding Strategy

Address supports controlled seeding via configuration:

```yaml
app:
  seed:
    enabled: true
```

### External Data Sources

#### Countries API

```
https://www.apicountries.com/countries
```

Provides:

- Country names
- ISO2
- ISO3
- Flags (SVG + PNG)

#### States API

```
https://api.countrystatecity.in/v1/countries/{country}/states
```

#### Postal Data

- GeoNames dataset (recommended for large imports)

---

## 🔎 Performance Considerations

- All frequently queried fields are indexed
- Case-insensitive uniqueness on street names
- Trigram search for fuzzy matching
- Cascading deletes only where logically valid
- UUID primary keys for distributed safety

---

## 🔐 Data Integrity Rules

- No duplicate street per city (case-insensitive)
- No duplicate postal code per city
- ISO2 and ISO3 must be unique
- Foreign keys enforce strict hierarchy
- Optional soft-delete strategy (if needed)

---

## 🧪 Example Queries

### Find Streets by Fuzzy Search

```sql
SELECT *
FROM address.street
WHERE name ILIKE '%hauptstr%'
ORDER BY similarity(name, 'hauptstr') DESC;
```

---

### Radius Search

```sql
SELECT *
FROM address.street
WHERE ST_DWithin(
    location,
    ST_MakePoint(9.1829, 48.7758)::geography,
    5000
);
```

## 📦 Deployment

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Ensure PostGIS image compatibility for architecture (ARM vs AMD).

---

## ⚙️ Local Development

Requirements:

- Java 25
- PostgreSQL 16
- PostGIS extension
- Flyway migrations enabled

Enable extension manually if needed:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;
```

## 🛡 Future Enhancements

- GraphQL interface
- Kafka integration for geo updates
- Reverse geocoding endpoint
- Geo-hashing optimization
- Country-specific address formatting rules
- Address validation scoring engine

---

## 📈 Scalability Strategy

- Stateless service
- Horizontal scaling ready
- DB indexing optimized
- Read-heavy architecture
- Partitioning possible for massive postal datasets

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

Address follows:

- Strict normalization
- High integrity over convenience
